    <h1>World Health Organization (WHO) Life Expectancy</h1>

    <h3>ðŸŒŽ Introduction ðŸŒŽ</h3>

    <p>
      The objective of this project is to analyze contributing factors to
      average life expectancy between countries. We will consider economic,
      health, and social factors and how they relate to life expectancy. Life
      expectancy is important to study as it is used to measure a population's
      health. We aim to discover relationships between these factors and life
      expectancy, offering insights into which factors contribute most to
      longer, healthier lives. Identifying key factors can help governments and
      policymakers prioritize areas of improvement to invest in, ultimately
      improving global health outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸŒŽ Data ðŸŒŽ</h3>

    <p>
      We are sourcing our data from Kaggle. The dataset has 2938 entries
      (observations) and 22 attributes. This dataset represents the average life
      expectancy in a country in a year (between 2000-2015). Each observation
      includes factors as described in the table below. Essentially, this data
      reflects health-related factors in a country each year and that year's
      average life expectancy.

        <p>
          Life expectancy serves as a key indicator of a nation's overall health
          and quality of life. We visualize each country's life expectancy using
          a dual world map, allowing for a side-by-side comparison with
          healthcare expenditure as a percentage of GDP. A dual map gives a
          clearer understanding of the relationship between healthcare spending
          and life expectancy across different regions.
        </p>

        <p>
          We used geographical data from
          <a
            href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/"
            target="_blank"
            >Natural Earth</a
          >
          to generate the world map. Discrepancies between country names in the
          life expectancy dataset and the Natural Earth dataset required manual
          preprocessing, and countries with missing data are displayed in light
          grey. The color gradient on the left map represents life expectancy in
          years (blue scale), while the right map represents healthcare
          expenditure as a percentage of GDP (red scale). Users can zoom in and
          out for a closer look, and both hovering and clicking on a specific
          country reveals its corresponding values.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at the map, countries in North America, Western Europe, and
          Australia have higher life expectancies and higher healthcare
          expenditure percengates. These regions tend to have advanced
          healthcare systems and better access to medical services. Many African
          nations, particularly in central and sub-Saharan regions, show
          significantly lower life expectancy. Factors such as limited
          healthcare infrastructure, higher rates of infectious diseases, and
          socio-economic challenges contribute to these lower figures. The dual
          map helps illustrate that while some high-spending countries achieve
          longer lifespans, the relationship is not always straightforward. Some
          countries spend relatively little but still have high life expectancy,
          while others invest more in healthcare but do not achieve
          proportionally better outcomes.

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          To complement this broad view, we visualize each country's life
          expectancy over time by comparing it to the international average for
          a more focused view. This visualization displays life expectancy in
          years over time, by country. The dashed line represents the average
          life expectancy across all countries over time. The selected country
          is then rendered to compare to the international average. The country
          with the lowest average life expectancy is Sierra Leone, with an
          average life expectancy of 46.11 years. In comparison, the country
          with the highest average life expectancy is Japan with an average
          expectancy of 82.54 years. The y-axis (Life Expectancy) ranges between
          30 and 95 years, since the dataset's minimum life expectancy across
          all countries is 36.3 years, and the maximum is 89.0 years.

    <h3>Education vs. Income Composition of Resources</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Beyond healthcare, socioeconomic factors such as education and income
          composition play a crucial role in determining a population's
          well-being, so we decided to visualize each country's average years of
          education and average income composition of resources in a scatter
          plot. Then, the county's status of Developing or Developed is labeled
          by color. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Income composition of resources (ICOR) measures how good a
          country is at using its resources. Resources can include human capital
          (skills, education, experience), economic resources (assets, income),
          social resources (networks), and personal resources (health,
          education). ICOR ranges between 0 and 1, where an ICOR of 1 means a country uses all of its resources to
          their fullest potential (100%), and values &lt 1 indicate &lt100% resource efficiency.
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed vs Developing status refers to a nation's industrial base and Human Development Index. See this <a
          href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developing_country"
          target="_blank"
          >page</a
        > for further detail. 
        </p>
        <p>
          The plot shows that Developed countries have
          both higher education rates and ICOR. Also, there are more Developing
          countries than Developed. South Sudan (Developing) has both the
          loweset average ICOR and years of schooling. Australia (Developed) has
          the highest average years of schooling. Norway (Developed) has the
          highests ICOR.

    <h3>Top 20 Countries by Infant Deaths</h3>

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          While life expectancy and socioeconomic factors shape overall health
          outcomes, specific public health crises, such as infant mortality and
          HIV/AIDS, reveal the drastic inequalities between countries. As shown
          in the above horizontal bar chart, in 2015, the countries with the
          highest number of infant deaths were primarily concentrated in regions
          with limited access to healthcare and high birth rates. This
          visualization reveals that countries such as India, Nigeria, and
          Pakistan suffered more infant deaths than others â€” this hints at a
          disparity in maternal and child healthcare as well as insufficient
          healthcare funding across these regions. By focusing on the top 20
          countries, the chart draws attention to where interventions could have
          greater impact in reducing infant mortality rates.

      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Another important public health issue is the prevalence of
          HIV/AIDS-related deaths. This visualization shows the trend of
          HIV/AIDS-related deaths over time in the five countries with the
          highest cumulative totals. The chart shows that in the early 2000s,
          countries like Swaziland, Zimbabwe, and Lesotho experienced very high
          numbers of HIV/AIDS-related deaths. However, in many of these
          countries, there is a noticeable decline in HIV/AIDS deaths over time,
          likely due to the increased availability of antiretroviral therapy
          (ART), public health campaigns, and aid programs. Despite this overall
          progress, the data indicates how the HIV/AIDS epidemic
          disproportionately affected specific regions, particularly in
          sub-Saharan Africa.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, our visualizations indicate that life expectancy has steadily
      increased from 2000 to 2015, reflecting advancements in healthcare and
      living conditions, though disparities remain across regions.
    </p>
    <p>Future Studies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Our findings suggest a clear connection between healthcare access and
        life expectancy, but a deeper dive into healthcare policy effectiveness
        could provide insights for future action.
      </li>
      <li>
        To address regional health disparities, future analyses should focus on
        identifying challenges in countries with lower health and education
        metrics for more targeted solutions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Many health challenges are worsened by environmental factors such as air
        pollution, access to clean water, and climate change-related natural
        disasters. Future analysis could incorporate environmental indicators to
        examine how they shape public health outcomes.
