    <h1>World Health Organization (WHO) Life Expectancy</h1>

    <h3>ðŸŒŽ Introduction ðŸŒŽ</h3>

    <p>
      The objective of this project is to analyze contributing factors to
      average life expectancy between countries. We will consider economic,
      health, and social factors and how they relate to life expectancy. Life
      expectancy is important to study as it is used to measure a population's
      health. We aim to discover relationships between these factors and life
      expectancy, offering insights into which factors contribute most to
      longer, healthier lives. Identifying key factors can help governments and
      policymakers prioritize areas of improvement to invest in, ultimately
      improving global health outcomes.
    </p>

    <h3>ðŸŒŽ Data ðŸŒŽ</h3>

    <p>
      We are sourcing our data from Kaggle. The dataset has 2938 entries
      (observations) and 22 attributes. This dataset represents the average life
      expectancy in a country in a year (between 2000-2015). Each observation
      includes factors as described in the table below. Essentially, this data
      reflects health-related factors in a country each year and that year's
      average life expectancy.

          This visualization displays life expectancy in years over time, by
          country. The dashed line represents the average life expectancy across
          all countries over time. The selected country is then rendered to
          compare to the international average. The country with the lowest
          average life expectancy is Sierra Leone, with an average life
          expectancy of 46.11 years. In comparison, the country with the highest
          average life expectancy is Japan with an average expectancy of 82.54
          years. The y-axis (Life Expectancy) ranges between 30 and 95 years,
          since the dataset's minimum life expectancy across all countries is
          36.3 years, and the maximum is 89.0 years.

          This scatter plot visualizes the relationship between a country's
          average years of schooling and the country's average income
          composition of resources. Then, the county's status of Developing or
          Developed is labeled by color. Income composition of resources (ICOR)
          measures how good a country is at using its resources. Resources can
          include human capital (skills, education, experience), economic
          resources (assets, income), social resources (networks), and personal
          resources (health, education). An ICOR of 1 means a country uses all
          of its resources to their fullest potential. The plot shows that
          Developed countries have both higher education rates and ICOR. Also,
          there are more Developing countries than Developed. South Sudan
          (Developing) has both the loweset average ICOR and years of schooling.
          Australia (Developed) has the highest average years of schooling.
          Norway (Developed) has the highests ICOR.

    <h3>Top 20 Countries by Infant Deaths</h3>

      </div>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          As shown in the above horizontal bar chart, in 2015, the countries
          with the highest number of infant deaths were primarily concentrated
          in regions with limited access to healthcare and high birth rates.
          This visualization reveals that countries such as India, Nigeria, and
          Pakistan suffered more infant deaths than others â€” this hints at a
          disparity in maternal and child healthcare as well as insufficient
          healthcare funding across these regions. By focusing on the top 20
          countries, the chart draws attention to where interventions could have
          greater impact in reducing infant mortality rates.

        <p>
          This visualization shows the trend of HIV/AIDS-related deaths over
          time in the five countries with the highest cumulative totals. The
          chart shows that in the early 2000s, countries like Swaziland,
          Zimbabwe, and Lesotho experienced very high numbers of
          HIV/AIDS-related deaths. However, in many of these countries, there is
          a noticeable decline in HIV/AIDS deaths over time, likely due to the
          increased availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART), public health
          campaigns, and aid programs. Despite this overall progress, the data
          indicates how the HIV/AIDS epidemic disproportionately affected
          specific regions, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa.

        <p>
          We visualize each country's life expectancy using a world map to
          identify any trends related to geographical location. We used
          geographical data from
          <a
            href="https://www.naturalearthdata.com/downloads/10m-cultural-vectors/"
            target="_blank"
            >Natural Earth</a
          >
          to generate the world map. Discrepancies between country names in the
          life expectancy dataset and the Natural Earth dataset required manual
          preprocessing, and countries with missing data are displayed in light
          grey. The color gradient on the map represents life expectancy in
          years. Users can zoom in and out on the map for a closer look, and
          clicking on a specific country reveals its life expectancy value.
        </p>

        <p>
          Looking at the map, countries in North America, Western Europe, and
          Australia have higher life expectancies. These regions tend to have
          advanced healthcare systems, higher living standards, and better
          access to medical services. Many African nations, particularly in
          central and sub-Saharan regions, show significantly lower life
          expectancy. Factors such as limited healthcare infrastructure, higher
          rates of infectious diseases, and socio-economic challenges contribute
          to these lower figures.

    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
    <p>
      Overall, our visualizations indicate that life expectancy has steadily
      increased from 2000 to 2015, reflecting advancements in healthcare and
      living conditions, though disparities remain across regions. To address
      these disparities, future analyses should focus on identifying challenges
      in countries with lower health and education metrics for more targeted
      solutions. Looking at more recent data beyond 2015 will also be helpful to
      assess changes in education, healthcare, and economics that may have
      occurred since then.
